# Djagno REST API

## Description
This is a simple Django REST API that allows users to create, read, update and delete Products.

Note: This project is still in development.
I have included django-debug-toolbar for debugging purposes,
so you can see the queries that are being executed.

### Endpoints
- /products/ - GET, POST
- /products/:id/ - GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- /categories/ - GET, POST
- /categories/:id/ - GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install the dependencies
4. Run the server
